# mqtt_blinds

Advanced MQTT blinds based on the original by jjhtpc (https://github.com/jjhtpc/esp8266MQTTBlinds).

I have created a tutorial at http://blog.assome.com/2017/05/automated-blinds-with-smartthings-and.html

I created a servo coupler for this at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2320388

This version adds the following:
- OTA updates
- Blinds can return to the previous selected level when turned back on
